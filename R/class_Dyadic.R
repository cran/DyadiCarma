#' @title The class to represent a dyadic matrix
#' @description The main class in the \code{Dyadic}-package used for representing three types of dyadic matrices: horizontal, vertical,
#' symmetric, and asymmetric.
#' @slot height positive integer, the number of dyadic levels;
#' @slot breadth positive integer, the breadth of the dyadic structure;
#' @slot type string, one of the following character strings: \code{horiz},\code{vert},\code{symm}, \code{asymm} which
#' indicates the type of dyadic matrix
#' \itemize{
#'     \item \code{horiz} horizontal,
#'     \item \code{vert} vertical,
#'     \item \code{symm} symmetric,
#'     \item \code{asymm} asymmetric,
#' }
#' where the last two types distinguish symmetrically dyadic matrices (they both have symmetric dyadic structure)
#' that correspond to symmetric or not symmetric matrices.
#' @slot entries list (of matrices); a list of the length \code{height} containing
#' \code{(2^(l)-1)*breadth x 2^(height-l)*breadth} matrices, where \code{l} is the index running through the list.
#' Each matrix in the list includes the entries corresponding to
#' \code{2^(height-l)} \code{(2^l-1)*breadth x breadth}-matrices
#' put side by side columnwise in the \code{l}th level of a dyadic structure.    In the 'symm'- and 'asymm'-cases, the terms below
#' diagonal on the diagonal blocks are set to zero.
#' @slot aentries list (of matrices); a list which is either empty if the slot \code{type} is not \code{'asymm'}
#' or of the length \code{height} otherwise, in which the case it contains
#' \code{(2^(l)-1)*breadth x 2^(height-l)*breadth} matrices, where \code{l} is the index running through the list.
#' Each matrix in the list includes the entries corresponding to \code{2^(height-l)}.
#' \code{(2^l-1)*breadth x breadth}-matrices
#' put side by side columnwise in the \code{l}th horizontal level of an asymmetric dyadic structure.
#' The terms above and on the diagonal in the diagonal blocks are set to zero because they are accounted in the slot \code{entries}.
#' @return running \code{new("Dyadic")} return an object that belongs to the class \code{Dyadic},
#' with the initialization of the default values for the fields.
